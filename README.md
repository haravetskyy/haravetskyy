# HeyðŸ‘‹ I'm Yuriy Haravetskyy

Hi there, Iâ€™m **Yuriy Haravetskyy** a beginner **Frontend Developer**. I'm studying front-end since 2019, but made a huge break that caused me forgetting most of the things that I've been learning that time. So, now I'm coming back to this sphere of activity with new much stronger passion.

### The list of tools I worked with:

- Frontend basics: _HTML_ and _CSS_
- Additional styling instruments as _SCSS_, _BEM_ methodology, _Tailwind_, _BootStrap_ and others
- _Reacts.js_
- _Firebase_

### What I'm currently developing myself in:

- Restoring my knowledge of **JavaScript**
- My **goal** for 2023-2024: stat learning of **TypeScript** and **react.js** for higher code quality
- Also studying in UITM in Rzeszow, Poland on faculty of computer science: programming

# Yuriy Haravetskyy

Hi there, Iâ€™m **Yuriy Haravetskyy** a beginner **Frontend Developer**. My web development journey began in 2019. I joined a Front-End bootcamp where I got to know the basics of web tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also had a chance to work on fun projects with other folks, focusing on page designs, cool animations, and making websites interactive. Plus, I've dipped my toes into React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

### The list of tools I worked with:

- Frontend basics: _HTML_ and _CSS_
- Additional styling tools as _SCSS_, _BEM_ methodology, _Tailwind_, _BootStrap_ and others
- _Reacts.js_
- _Firebase_

### What I'm currently developing myself in:

- Enhancing my knowledge of **JavaScript**
- My **goal** for 2023-2024 is to deepen my knowledge in React, TypeScript and other libraries to be able to write more reliable and efficient code
- Also studying in UITM in Rzeszow, Poland on faculty of computer science: programming
